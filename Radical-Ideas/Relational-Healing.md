The brain is a better analogy for the cosmic spiritual essence of the universe that ties all of us together than the ocean. Many people say that we are like waves within a cosmic ocean, all one, all part of something bigger, unified. But really, we are like neurons, independent and locally divided, but together, somehow, in the superconscious beyond our conscious, coming together to form a singularized intelligence.

The brain that connects us is desperately trying to heal the divides that torment Him or Her or Them, or however you want to call our shared cosmic world.

The constancy of light *in vacuo* across reference frames taught us the tolerance of the weird and bizarre. The principle of relativity taught us the essentialness of equality: my physics are your physics; your physics are my physics.

These ideas were necessary for us to integrate, socially and scientifically, but the implied physics model and what we learned from these postulates cannot be the complete picture. There is something else, beyond what physics knows, that is intelligent and alive. Something more absolute, and even weirder than what we previously thought or would've had the palate for. So, take this idea, described below, with some open-mindedness.
