# Overview

The archetype of the Alderman prides himself in Auto Insurance. It’s a service that gives people what they need, right? There’s a whole system around it. “Everybody” agrees it’s not just paramount but also morally important. And yet, inspecting closer, it’s literally a flat tax to poor people that costs them oftentimes as much as their paychecks. The immorality is so extreme, considering that those poor people might actually *own* the car that they are being charged a subscription fee for, that it can’t even be described in this one paragraph.

What can happen really is atrocious. And here is a case study from which some of the worst scenarios that this system creates can be extrapolated:

Say I own a car that I fully paid-off. Say I keep that car in the apartment complex where I live. Say my insurance, due to some freak ambiguous accident, charges me $1200 for the next 6-month policy. Say my mom is poor, I have thousands of dollars of college student debt that would default to her if I died, and I recently became unemployed, was suicidal, and sick. Say I can’t afford to pay that $1200 fee and there are no significantly better options. Say the car I own is un-drivable, but is repairable and worth too much to dispose or sell, and has sentimental value to me. Say I'm also incapacitated or hospitalized for some time due to being sick. And say my apartment complex prohibits cars without license plates from being parked there. Say the law requires that license plates be returned to the DMV for any uninsured cars. Say I don't have enough property that can be repossessed to pay off the insurer, except perhaps the car that it's insuring. Say English isn't my mom's primary language and we immigrated here legally as Jewish refugees from Uzbekistan.

**Question:** What happens to me, having not broken any laws, for simply existing, due to the auto insurance system?

**Answer:** For simply existing, I get evicted, arrested, or my un-drivable car that I fully own gets repossessed. 

**Question:** What might happen to my immigrant Russian-speaking mom, who is poor, if, upon me learning those unpreventable threats, I commit suicide and my student debt defaults to her?

**Answer:** She gets arrested, or has to learn what "bankruptcy" means.

In a country of 300,000,000 Americans not only is this possible, but most of it happened to me (thankfully not her) earlier this year!

Best case scenario under all of those circumstances, the fully-owned car gets repossessed. As a result of car *insurance*. I hope that's clear. </br> &nbsp; $\square$

### These were the notes I took around this, in real-time:

- "I'm getting overcharged for an accident in 2022 where an 18-wheeler hit my car while I was parked legally on the shoulder of a road in a hit-and-run, where I broke no laws and the driver kept driving and could've killed me. My insurance policy price is more than doubled for that, but that isn't right. An 18-wheeler hit my car in a hit-and-run while I was legally parked. And since I didn't have collision at the time, my insurance (then Geico) didn't even have to pay for the damages, and my car was completely wrecked. So Geico should not be charging me any more than the baseline quote." - Sent to a Geico support bot today before being connected to an agent.
- Actually, it turned out they quoted me for a single speeding ticket 3 years ago, minus a week or so. More than double from ~$180 to ~$540 over their would-be baseline quote.
- That's still an improvement, since (with comprehensive, meaning including collision), Allstate wanted to charge me $1098.46 with automatic renewal (and they did 6 months previous to that without warning me, as I just checked in my bank records).
- And Amica has a processing window that would’ve gone a few days over my current plan’s renewal/expiration date and only accepts covered customers. No grace period.
- Some rep at State Farm changed my quote after I had a really good one, because the other rep’s family member got sick. That was really unfortunate. The other rep’s family member died and his buddy-colleague ruined a good deal for him and me while he was away.
- And DMV requires you to take action to cancel liability insurance, which charges $748.77 somehow for 6 months from my AllState agency after all collision/comprehensive and any other possible coverages besides liability removed, or so they told me. Geico and Amica both offered moderately lower quotes but still obscene. The action DMV requires is to surrender my license plates, meaning to go to the DMV office, and return license plates that...
    - ...okay, this is going to sound ridiculous but that are attached to my car via zip ties that were attached in a way that had sentimental value to me by the stranger who sold us the car when my uncle and I went through a pretty intense journey to get the car, and removing them feels like a desecration of that good-faith unlikely synchronicity-miracle that happened involving the whole story of how I got that car (starting from the hit-and-run) and the shared journey with my uncle, and thematically broke with the bureaucratic hustle and powerlessness that followed.
    - To do: Rephrase spiritual point.
- My car battery is dead and I can’t even drive the car, and I’m obligated to do all of this in order not to pay an obscene subscription fee, while unemployed after getting unjustly terminated (with student debt), just for having the used 2007 Toyota Prius that I bought in full and own, which cost less than what the car insurance agencies are trying to charge, despite… and here’s the kicker… the fact that **I have never been in an accident that was my fault in my life.**

So all of this might seem okay, because you might think I can get by without a car, or rather, with a car but without driving it. But don't think of me then, let's zoom out to my mom. My family is in poverty and my mom had to deal with this extortion all her time in America. 
- Update: At my apartment, we don't have a place where I can legally keep my car without license plates, so I am legally required to pay the insurance liability fee, for a car I can't use.
    - The fee I end up having to pay, to AllState, if I don't change insurance companies by tomorrow, most likely includes a charge for the hit-and-run I was in that wasn't my fault (and could've killed me), since it's $748.77 under automatic renewal with all coverages removed and only the liability fee. Geico in comparison quoted me ~$540, and Amica, which has a one week processing period, ~$440. I can either (1) let AllState charge me for a month, get some money refunded, and then switch to Amica, or (2) switch to Geico by tomorrow. These are labor-and-expense requirements put on an unemployed person in suffering health condition... on property that the unemployed person fully paid off.
		- My eczema got really severe for a time, and so I did a prolonged fast that I’m coming off of now.
    - Had I died, and if I didn’t have savings, my mom, who is poor, would've been charged with all of my student debt, as a punishment for the driver of that 18-wheeler's hit-and-run, and no insurance company or government institution or religious organization or charity would exist to help.

These things might seem like small impositions of the state and corporate powers, but these are huge sums of money charged greedily at a flat rate to poor people and rich people alike, just for having a car. Monthly, or every 6 months, a tax for car ownership. And tons of bureaucracy.

This should be nationalized. If the state thinks it's important, they should pay for it.

Auto insurance should be nationalized.

- Update: I ended up getting a synchronistic phonecall and voicemail from the insurance rep from State Farm whose family member had died who'd originally offered me a good deal, despite not having contacted State Farm or informed them that I was looking for insurance, and not having gotten inquiry calls from them previously, the day after sending this document by email to my insurance rep at Allstate (who said she had no power over the rates). He offered me $452 with State Farm for 6 months (but I would've had to take a 6-hour course and have my location tracked through their Drive Save & Save app). Then I got a quote from Progressive entirely online without having to call anyone, conveniently, for $315, I paid with Apple Pay, they faxed my documents to Allstate, and I got confirmation with Allstate over the phone that they received the faxed documents and that my plan with them was cancelled, and I wouldn't be charged any additional payments, including the $748.77 that was scheduled for May 1st. The Progressive online portal was transparent about what tickets/accidents they were/weren't charging me for and how much was being charged and got the information accurate by default automatically, and even allowed me to add my insurance card digitally to Apple Wallet on my phone through their straightforward app. </br> </br>Ah, now I just got a voicemail from the rep at Allstate saying she made a mistake. I called back (it's near 5pm) and the guy who answered told me what she told me (that I shouldn't be charged on May 1st), but he couldn't tell me what the mistake was because that's all she told me too, so she'll call me back tomorrow to "rectify" the mistake. </br> </br>Most likely it's to inform me that the charging period, scheduled for May 1st, technically began from April 14th and that I would still be charged from then until the beginning of my new policy with Progressive on April 29th. Not understanding this refund policy, I'd selected April 29th beginning-date instead of April 25th (today) unfortunately.
- My guess was correct and the rep said I wouldn't be charged more than about $40 for the 15 extra days. I did the math and it should've added up to about ~$60. When I checked the Allstate app on 04/30/24, I saw I was still being charged $748.77 and so I emailed the head of that Allstate agency. She replied:

> Hi Sam,
> You policy with Allstate has not been terminated, since progressive has not sent us the request.
> To do this faster please email me your ID card from progressive and I will terminate your policy.
>
> Thank you

- I replied:

> Oh, apologies. Attached is a photo of the ID card.
>
> Also, to specify, I talked to two reps on three occasions, and not only did Progressive fax the policy, but [name anonymized] confirmed that she received it and confirmed twice that my policy with Allstate was cancelled. She even left a voicemail and confirmed the second time that I would not be charged more than about $40.

> See attached photo of the ID card.

This has all been a lot of trouble for not even having a driveable car or job, and the bare minimum liability insurance. And mandatory, since I can't keep this car without a licence plate in my apartment complex, so I can't return the license plate to the DMV and cancel having insurance. And expensive, mostly manual, and redundant, full of bureaucratic landmines. For no benefit over a public nationalized auto-insurance program paid for by much smaller tax-dollars instead of insane flat-rate extortions. What if I got sick and missed the payments, or couldn't make the payments? Would they have charged me more? Would I have gone to jail? Just for owning a fully-paid-off (un-drivable) car?
