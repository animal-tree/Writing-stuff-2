# Overview

The archetype of the Alderman prides himself in Auto Insurance. It’s a service that gives people what they need, right? There’s a whole system around it. “Everybody” agrees it’s not just paramount but also morally important. And yet, inspecting closer, it’s literally a flat tax to poor people that costs them oftentimes as much as their paychecks. The immorality is so extreme, considering that those poor people might actually *own* the car that they are being charged a subscription fee for, that it can’t even be described in this one paragraph.

What can happen really is atrocious. And here is a case study from which some of the worst scenarios that this system creates can be extrapolated:

- Say I own a car that I fully paid-off.
- Say insurance companies charge me exorbitant prices for a 6-month policy due a to a speeding ticket from a little less than 3 years ago.
- Say my mom and I are poor, I recently became unemployed, and we can’t afford to pay those prices.
- Say the car I own is un-drivable due to a broken part (say, dead battery), but is repairable.
- Say I keep that car in the apartment complex where my mom and I live.
- Say my apartment complex prohibits cars without license plates from being parked there.
- And say the law requires that license plates be turned in to the DMV for any uninsured cars. 
- Say I don't have enough property that can be repossessed to pay off the insurer, except perhaps the car that it's insuring. 

**Question:** What happens to me, having not broken any laws, for simply existing, due to the auto insurance system?

**Answer:** For simply existing, my mom and I get evicted, I get arrested, or my un-drivable car that I fully own gets repossessed. 

**Question:** Say the car wasn't un-driveable because I repaired it (which I did later). What might happen to my mom, who is poor, if I was the victim of a car accident that kills me (say, my car gets side-swiped by an 18-wheeler while I'm in it), and the car goes to my mom. Does my mom at least get to keep the car that her son fully paid off?

**Answer:** Maybe the car insurance pays for the damages to the car, but the car still has to be disposed of since she can't afford to pay for the mandatory car insurance, or get evicted since she still can't keep the car at the apartment without a license plate. She then becomes responsible for selling a car under a deadline amid grief for her son at the threat of getting arrested or having the potentially-valuable car repossessed otherwise, due to auto insurance. If the car is valuable and she doesn't manage to sell it by herself, the auto insurance system ends up just robbing a grieving mom, who's not in debt, of a valuable car that was fully owned, potentially with sentimental value, as their fee for providing auto insurance.

Best case scenario under all of those circumstances, the fully-owned car is lost. As a result of car *insurance*. 

Meanwhile, there is no advantage of private auto insurance to a public, nationalized, taxpayer-paid government auto insurance program (e.g. AutoInsuranceForAll) since both require mandatory fees, except the private version extorts customers, charges flat rates regardless of economic class, doesn't cover reasonable damages like broken parts nor (unless extra fees are paid) collisions, and is also extremely bureaucratic, with worse bureaucracy than what government programs have (see [below](#these-were-the-notes-i-chronicled-this-year-about-these-events-on-github-in-real-time-as-i-dealt-with-the-insurance-companies) for details).

To reiterate: In every scenario, the best-possible-outcome is that we lose the insured car. That's a contradiction to car insurance with no sense or justification, especially since the car is fully-owned. 

In a country of 300,000,000 Americans not only is this possible, but most of it happened to me (thankfully not my mom) earlier this year (except for the 18-wheeler hit-and-run while parked on the shoulder of a bridge — that happened to me in early 2022, and my insurance at the time didn't pay for the damages/car since my mom and I only had the mandatory liability insurance and not collision, since collision coverage is expensive and I was under my mom's Geico insurance at the time, and my car by the way was completely wrecked from that 18-wheeler's hit-and-run).

## These were the notes I chronicled this year about these events on GitHub, in real-time as I dealt with the insurance companies:

- "I'm getting overcharged for an accident in 2022 where an 18-wheeler hit my car while I was parked legally on the shoulder of a road in a hit-and-run, where I broke no laws and the driver kept driving and could've killed me. My insurance policy price is more than doubled for that, but that isn't right. An 18-wheeler hit my car in a hit-and-run while I was legally parked. And since I didn't have collision at the time, my insurance (then Geico) didn't even have to pay for the damages, and my car was completely wrecked. So Geico should not be charging me any more than the baseline quote." - Sent to a Geico support bot today before being connected to an agent.
- Actually, it turned out they quoted me for a single speeding ticket 3 years ago, minus a week or so. More than double from ~$180 to ~$540 over their would-be baseline quote. I was looking to switch from Allstate.
- That's still an improvement, since (with comprehensive, meaning including collision), Allstate wanted to charge me $1098.46 with automatic renewal (and they did 6 months previous to that without warning me, as I just re-verified to get the exact number on in my bank records). They randomly spiked up the price from ~$800, which was the price I originally got with them.
- And Amica, which offered a lower quote (~$440), has a processing window that would’ve gone a few days over my current plan’s renewal/expiration date and only accepts covered customers. No grace period, requires missing the boat on avoiding Allstate's excess charges if not done more than two weeks in advance, which is ironic since their commercial is of them holding the subway door when it’s about to close.
- I remember years ago I ended up getting stuck with Allstate because one rep at State Farm spiked my quote while the other one who was about to close with me had to leave at the last second due to a family emergency.
- And DMV requires you to take action (turn in your license plates) to cancel liability insurance, which is a bare minimum requirement by law otherwise, and Allstate tries to extort $748.77 for just the liability insurance, with all collision/comprehensive and any other possible coverages besides liability removed (meaning, if I was hit by another hit-and-run again, my insurance again wouldn't cover it, despite the enormous price tag). Geico and Amica both offered moderately lower quotes but still obscene. The action DMV requires is to surrender my license plates, meaning to go to the DMV office, and return license plates that...
    - ...okay, this is going to sound ridiculous but that are attached to my car via zip ties that were attached in a way that had sentimental value to me by the stranger who sold us the car when my uncle and I went through a pretty intense journey to get the car, and removing them feels like a desecration of that good-faith unlikely synchronicity-miracle that happened involving the whole story of how I got that car (starting from the hit-and-run) and the shared journey with my uncle, and thematically broke with the bureaucratic hustle and powerlessness that followed.
    - To do: Rephrase spiritual point.
- My car battery is dead and I can’t even drive the car, and I’m obligated to do all of this in order not to pay an obscene subscription fee, while unemployed after getting unjustly terminated (with student debt), just for having the used 2007 Toyota Prius that I bought in full and own, which cost less than what the car insurance agencies are trying to charge, despite… and here’s the kicker… the fact that **I have never been in an accident that was my fault in my life.**

So all of this might seem okay, because you might think I can get by without a car, or rather, with a car but without driving it. But don't think of me then, let's zoom out to my mom. My family is in poverty and my mom had to deal with this extortion all her time in America. Imagine being a single immigrant mom of two kids and dealing with these injustices of bureaucracy and price gouging while supporting parents and kids.

- Update: I can't legally keep my car without license plates in my apartment complex, so I'm legally required to pay the insurance liability fee or else get evicted, for a car I can't use.
    - The fee I end up having to pay, to AllState, if I don't change insurance companies by tomorrow, most likely includes a charge for the hit-and-run I was in that wasn't my fault (and could've killed me), since it's $748.77 with them having removed all coverages and only keeping the bare-minimum liability fee. Geico in comparison quoted me ~$540, and Amica, which has a one week processing period, ~$440. I can either (1) let AllState charge me for a month, get some money refunded, and then switch to Amica, or (2) switch to Geico by tomorrow. No matter what, the extortions are insane. These are labor-and-expense requirements put on an unemployed person... on unusable property that the unemployed person fully paid off.
    - My eczema got really severe for a time, and so I did a prolonged fast that I’m coming off of now.
    	- Edit: My eczema was severe for another [N months] (ongoing) due to persisting stress and other externally invented responsibilities.
    - Had I died from that hit-and-run, and if I didn’t have savings, my mom, who is poor, would've been charged with all of my student debt, as a punishment for the driver of that 18-wheeler's hit-and-run, and no insurance company or government institution or religious organization or charity would exist to help.

These things might seem like small impositions of the state and corporate powers, but these are huge sums of money charged greedily at a flat rate to poor people and rich people alike, just for having a car. Monthly, or every 6 months, a tax for car ownership. And tons of bureaucracy.

This should be publicized and made affordable and accountable. If the state thinks it's important, they should pay for it.

Auto insurance should be nationalized.

Also, car insurance should pay for all car damages for people, including, e.g., dead batteries.

- Update: I ended up getting a synchronistic phonecall and voicemail from the insurance rep from State Farm whose family member had died who'd originally offered me a good deal, despite not having contacted State Farm or informed them that I was looking for insurance, and not having gotten inquiry calls from them previously, the day after sending this document by email to my insurance rep at Allstate (who said she had no power over the rates). He offered me $452 with State Farm for 6 months (but I would've had to take a 6-hour course and have my location tracked through their Drive Save & Save in-car device). Then I got a quote from Progressive entirely online without having to call anyone, conveniently, for $315, I paid with Apple Pay, they faxed my documents to Allstate, and I got confirmation with Allstate over the phone that they received the faxed documents and that my plan with them was cancelled, and I wouldn't be charged any additional payments, including the $748.77 that was scheduled for May 1st. The Progressive online portal was transparent about what tickets/accidents they were/weren't charging me for and how much was being charged ($315) and got the information accurate by default automatically, and even allowed me to add my insurance card digitally to Apple Wallet on my phone through their straightforward app. </br> </br>Ah, now I just got a voicemail from the rep at Allstate saying she made a mistake. I called back (it's near 5pm) and the guy who answered told me what she told me (that I shouldn't be charged on May 1st), but he couldn't tell me what the mistake was because that's all she told me too, so she'll call me back tomorrow to rectify the mistake. </br> </br>Most likely it's to inform me that the charging period, scheduled for May 1st, technically began from April 14th and that I would still be charged from then until the beginning of my new policy with Progressive on April 29th. Not understanding this refund policy, I'd selected April 29th beginning-date instead of April 25th (today) unfortunately.
- My guess was correct and the rep said I wouldn't be charged more than about $40 for the 15 extra days. I did the math and it should've added up to about ~$60. When I checked the Allstate app on 04/30/24, I saw I was still being charged $748.77 and so I emailed the head of that Allstate agency. She replied:

> Hi Sam,
> You policy with Allstate has not been terminated, since progressive has not sent us the request.
> To do this faster please email me your ID card from progressive and I will terminate your policy.
>
> Thank you

- I replied:

> I talked to two reps on three occasions, and not only did Progressive fax the policy, but [name anonymized] confirmed that she received it and confirmed twice that my policy with Allstate was cancelled. She even left a voicemail and confirmed the second time that I would not be charged more than about $40.
>
> See attached photo of the ID card.

After this, they finally terminated my policy, and otherwise would've charged me $748.77. Also, instead of the ~$40, they ended up charging $68.39. 

This has all been a lot of trouble for not even having a driveable car or job, and the bare minimum liability insurance. And mandatory, since I can't keep this car without a licence plate in my apartment complex, so I can't return the license plate to the DMV and cancel having insurance. And expensive, mostly manual, and redundant, full of bureaucratic landmines. For no benefit over a public nationalized auto-insurance program paid for by much smaller tax-dollars instead of insane flat-rate extortions. What if I got sick and missed the payments, or couldn't make the payments? Would they have charged me more? Would I have gone to jail? Just for owning a fully-paid-off (un-drivable) car?
