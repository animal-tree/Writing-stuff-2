# Conclusive Disproof of Lorentz/Einstein Relativity

Let us consider 4 reference frames. $K^{(1)}, K^{(2)}, K^{(3)},$ and $K^{(4)}$.

We can compute the prediction of the Lorentz transformation (Einstein Special Relativity) from $K^{(i)}$ to $K^{(j)}$ as $L^{K^{(i)}}(K^{(j)}) = T(K^{(j)}), X(K^{(j)})$ for the time and space coordinates respectively.

All observers should agree upon their translations, if the Lorentz transformation is a valid description of the nature of relativity in any mathematical sense.

It suffices to define one relative scenario that is objectively possible that contradicts this requirement to conclusively eliminate special relativity as a theory on a mathematically constrained universe.

Suppose the 4 reference frames $K^{(1)}, K^{(2)}, K^{(3)}, K^{(4)}$ are 4 people situated in the origin of their respective reference frames.

Without loss of generality, consider them walking in a single row, as if the x-axis, on a flat surface positioned uniformly in the y and z axes.

Their relative velocities are as follows:

$V^{(K^{(i)})}(K^{(1)}) < V^{(K^{(i)})}(K^{(3)}) < V^{(K^{(i)})}(K^{(2)}) < V^{(K^{(i)})}(K^{(4)})$ from the perspective of all 4 observers $K^{(i)}$. Furthermore, from the perspective of $K^{(1)}$, observers 3 and 4 are moving in equal speeds in opposite directions.

This scenario may be drawn geometrically from the perspective of each person to make the problem setup more clear.

(not to scale)

$K^{(1)}, K^{(2)}, K^{(3)}, K^{(4)}$ are positioned spatially in order for clarity's sake, but this is not a requirement.

We will now show the disagreement of the time dilation formula, then derive the mechanical possibility of those people holding light clocks directly from the Lorentz transformation.

Observer 1 attributes the following time dilation to <br>
Observer<br><br>

There is the question of whether the time dilation formula is a direct consequence and necessary implication of the Lorentz transformation (and therefore its derived equivalent, Special Relativity).

To proceed we will prove this mechanical construction by assuming only the truth or applicability of Lorentz/Einstein relativity.

### Disproving the constancy of light across reference frames

If we construct a light clock that is one measuring-unit length $I$, then we have disproved Einstein's first postulate.

The constancy of the speed of light across all reference frames *in vacuo* has been disproven, since $x^{(i)} = c t^{(i)}$ requires $\Delta t^{(i)} = \frac{\Delta x^{(i)}}{c} = \frac{I}{t_i}$, where $I$ is a unit measuring length and $t_i$ is the time of traversal from one end of the light clock to the other, or whatever constitutes a unit-time increment (e.g. two-way light clock and divide by $2c$). This time delta $t_i$ however is not the same for two observers traveled in two different directions by the same velocity, according to the Lorentz transformation from other observers. 

### Disproving the principle of relativity

$K^{(1)} \leftrightarrow (K^{(3)}, K^{(4)}) \leftrightarrow K^{(2)}$

### Disproving relative isotropy

Isotropy says: "the laws of physics to the left are the laws of physics to the right." The predicted time dilation from the left is different from the predicted time dilation to the right (of observer $K^{(3)}$).

<br>

Hypothesized Conclusion: Lorentz transformation can only account for bodies accelerated from one reference frame $K^{(i)}$, starting from a rest velocity relative to that reference frame.
