# Magic Smartwatch Probabilities

**Wristwatch probabilities** are like your wrist but able to turn in full 360° motions. Your thumb points in the "polarity", capable of curling inward or stretching outward. Your arm is the velocity vector (unlike your arm, able to change size to represent the velocity magnitude).

The choice of left wrist or right wrist is arbitrary.

The phase-hand of the wristwatch on your wrist (like a minute-hand, but revolving in 360° circles at varying frequencies and with variable size representing a phase amplitude) has two dimensions: the probability dimension (from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock) and the polarity dimension (from midnight to 6), like "x" and "y" dimensions relative to you.

As the phase-hand turns at a given frequency, its magnitude in the probability dimension represents the sine wave-like nature of matter, and constructively and destructively interacts with other wristwatches that cross its location. For example, wrists (velocity vectors) intersect in space. One of them reads 1 o'clock, the other reads 7 o'clock. Both wristwatches have phase-hands of the same size/amplitude. Together, they destructively interfere (via vector addition/averaging of their phase-hands) to create a probability of 0, even though individually they both represent a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ (via the "probability", or relative-"x", dimension magnitude).

The polarity and polarity dimension are ignored and can be regarded like imaginary dimensions for the purpose of computing probabilities. However, they will be used in a real, physical way in a moment to describe and unify the mechanisms of wave, spin, and polarization/or magnetism in particles and composite particles, as well as answer the mystery of Baryonic asymmetry.

If you like, wristwatch probabilities can be thought of as a more physical, real spinnor. Spinnors 2.0. Spinnors as physical objects in space that vote amongst each other through location dependent interference. No imaginary units. 

Unit vector with a coefficient amplitude $A$, a rate of rotation $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$, a phase angle $\theta_\omega$ and a polarity angle $\theta_\mathrm{N}$ relative to a velocity vector $v$.

- The amplitude $A$ corresponds to the radius corresponds to the frequency corresponds to the momentum corresponds to $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$ ($t$ is time), in order to satisfy the common physics relations: $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{v}{f}$, where $\lambda$ is wavelength, $h$ is [Planck's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) (any smaller units and you "walk the plank" of the universe's limits), and $p$ is momentum, which equals $mv$ for fermions, where $m$ is mass.
- A better way to visualize is a curve going into and out of space at varying orientations.
  - I think these "heads"[^1] are just going up and down in an independent concealed dimension and oriented in variable "polarity" ways perpendicular to velocity.
- The wristwatch just visually literalizes the math of that.
  - It can also be described as a vibrating compass and/or $\theta_\omega$ can be replaced with a simple harmonic oscillator ($\frac{\partial^2 \alpha}{\partial t^2}$ $\propto$ $-f \alpha$, where $\alpha$ denotes the probability-dimension magnitude).
- However, with these non-wristwatch descriptions the polarity-dimension magnitude (the length of your thumb) is no longer intrinsically tied to $\alpha$ the way it's expected to be in EM waves (outward vs. inward facing direction of your thumb), by default.

[^1]: What I call these "wristwatches", as in, "heads belonging to a wave packet."
