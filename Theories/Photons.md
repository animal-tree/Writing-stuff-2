Photon probabilities as multi-head oscillators with memory traces. Local, Markovian.

Technically any entangled composition of matter.

Entanglement (due to interactions, e.g., non-zero derivatives) as consciousness singularization model.

Can use fermion (W), photon (_/\\\_), and angular proba (o) to model.

Angular proba happens to be more uniform as a differentiable squashing function for constraining/regularizing ranges than Sigmoid perhaps, and works for single photon interference case and varying projection screen distances.
