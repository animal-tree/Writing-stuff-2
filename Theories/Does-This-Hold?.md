The "orbit" / "shell" / "energy-level" of an atom corresponds proportionally (or rather monotonically, positively increasing) with the radius away from the nucleus of the atom. Let's write that as

$$n \propo r, \text{(Relationship 1)}$$

where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the energy-level and $r$ is the radius.

According to de Broglie,

$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$

Then:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv},$$

since the momentum of fermions is $p = mv$, where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity.

This gives us:

$$v = \frac{h}{m\lambda}. \quad\quad \text{(First de Broglie velocity equation)}$$

de Broglie also says:

$$2\pi r = \hat{n}\lambda,$$

that is, requiring the wavelength to fit into the circumference of each energy-level $\hat{n} \in \mathbb{N}$ times.

Standardly, the energy-level is assumed to be the same as the wavelength-count integer ($n = \hat{n}$ is standardly assumed).

We thus standardly have:

$$2\pi r = n\lambda.$$

Rewriting this equation for $\lambda$ and plugging it into the "First de Broglie velocity equation," you get:

$$v = \frac{hn}{m2\pi r}. \text{(Second de Broglie velocity equation)}$$

So now we have the following relationship:

$$v \propo \frac{n}{r}. \text{(Relationship 2)}$$

Finally, according to Coulomb, the centripetal force of the orbit of the electron around the nuclear ($ma_c$, where $a_c$ is the centripetal acceleration) is:

$$ma_c = \frac{Kq_1q_2}{r^2}, \text{(Coulomb's law)}$$

where $q_1, q_2$ are the charges of the electron and nucleus respectively, and $K$ is Coulomb's constant. 

Meanwhile, the centripetal acceleration of a circular orbit is: $a_c = \frac{v}{r}$.

Plugging this into Coulomb's law, we get:

$$m\frac{v}{r} = \frac{Kq_1q_2}{r^2}, \text{(Coulomb's law)},$$

which gives us (by rearrangement):

$$\rightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{Kq_1q_2}{mr}}$$

and subsequently a new relationship:

$$v \propo \frac{1}{r}. \text{(Relationship 3)}$$

So we now have three necessary relationships, if all standard assumption hold:

$$
\begin{align}
&n \propo r \\
&v \propo \frac{n}{r} \\
&v \propo \frac{1}{r}
\end{align}
$$

This is of course only possible if $n$ increases slower than $r$. However, since $n$ increments by integer values and $r$ is constrained by the size of an atom (in meters), $r$ increases at much smaller than integer values per energy-level. Therefore, I have disproven *something* about this standard set of assumptions. $\square$
