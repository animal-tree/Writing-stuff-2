### Shouldn’t centripetal force create a stronger sense of gravity on the sun-side of the Earth?

Yes, though also the sun’s gravity would be slightly higher.

But overall, this seems like an under-appreciated fact about the distribution of perceived gravity and perhaps can be sensed by the body as more than just day and night.

It’s amazing in 2024 it’s unknown how much of the balance is centripetal vs. sun’s gravity, but I imagine sun’s gravity is pretty small and I imagine people would’ve measured the mass difference if the centripetal effect wasn’t also pretty small.

Still, that’s basic gravity, and just because it’s unmeasurable doesn’t mean it’s not true/fundamental.

Shouldn’t the Earth’s angular acceleration create a bigger centripetal force than it does?

It’s funny, centrifugal force, like along the equator, due to Earth’s rotation, is a well known phenomena that changes sensed gravity https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Earths-rotation-create-centrifugal-force-against-everything-on-its-surface-If-so-does-that-mean-we-arent-experiencing-gravity-as-strong-as-it-should-be

Why aren’t we considering Earth’s angular acceleration? That, fundamentally, is centripetal force. 

This actually sort of answers it. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/qed9rx/comment/hhs96qh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button </br>
But clearly it’s not a well know/understood/appreciated phenomenon in physics.

But then this makes a counterpoint: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration
“Gravitation therefore does not cause proper acceleration, because the same gravity acts equally on the inertial observer.“</br>
And yet centripetal force exists, so this can’t be right…?</br>
The gravity from the sun is the same, and the inertial velocity of human is the same. (Same as for the Earth). - in the case of gravity</br>
Whereas in centripetal force, the angular (inward) acceleration of the observer is detached from the angular (inward) acceleration of the “gravity simulator”, so the gravity-unaffected human only has the inertial velocity, but not the inward pull. So that creates an extra (“simulated”) gravity sensation. - in the case of centripetal force</br>
The two are not equivalent.

Okay, resolution^. Question answered. No.

### No. See above. (Maybe. See below)

Gravity ties a tether to both revolver (Earth) and observer (human).

But what if the human was hanging on the tether in the centripetal force example?

Answer 1: They would still feel the “simulated gravity”.

- So what’s special about gravity, and in particular the Earth’s revolution around the sun, that prevents the sensation of “extra gravity” (centripetal force)?

Answer 2: They would no longer feel the “simulated gravity” towards the other revolving mass.

- Then okay.

In good faith, I’ll assume Answer 2.

And yet…

I’m not sure.

I think if I hung onto that tether I’d still be drawn towards the edge of the spinning contraption. Why? Because my velocity pulls that way, and velocity is inertial; acceleration isn’t.

### Therefore, I conclude physicists are dumb. There’s some extra mass during daytime hours.

- It *might* be offset by sun’s gravity.
