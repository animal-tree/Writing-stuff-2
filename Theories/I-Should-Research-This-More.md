# Debate

### Shouldn’t centripetal force create a stronger sense of gravity on the sun-side of the Earth?

Yes, though also the sun’s gravity would be slightly higher.

But overall, this seems like an under-appreciated fact about the distribution of perceived gravity and perhaps can be sensed by the body as more than just day and night.

It’s amazing in 2024 it’s unknown how much of the balance is centripetal vs. sun’s gravity, but I imagine sun’s gravity is pretty small and I imagine people would’ve measured the mass difference if the centripetal effect wasn’t also pretty small.

Still, that’s basic gravity, and just because it’s unmeasurable doesn’t mean it’s not true/fundamental.

Shouldn’t the Earth’s angular acceleration create a bigger centripetal force than it does?

#

It’s funny, centrifugal force, like along the equator, due to Earth’s rotation, is a well known phenomenon that changes sensed gravity https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Earths-rotation-create-centrifugal-force-against-everything-on-its-surface-If-so-does-that-mean-we-arent-experiencing-gravity-as-strong-as-it-should-be

Why aren’t we considering Earth’s angular acceleration? That, fundamentally, is centripetal force. 

This actually sort of answers it. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/qed9rx/comment/hhs96qh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button </br>
But clearly it’s not a well known/understood/appreciated phenomenon in physics.

But then this makes a counterpoint: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration
“Gravitation therefore does not cause proper acceleration, because the same gravity acts equally on the inertial observer.“</br>
And yet centripetal force exists, so this can’t be right…?</br>
The gravity from the sun is the same, and the inertial velocity of human is the same. (Same as for the Earth). - in the case of gravity</br>
Whereas in centripetal force, the angular (inward) acceleration of the observer is detached from the angular (inward) acceleration of the “gravity simulator”, so the gravity-unaffected human only has the inertial velocity, but not the inward pull. So that creates an extra (“simulated”) gravity sensation. - in the case of centripetal force</br>
The two are not equivalent.

Okay, resolution^. Question answered. No.

### No. See above. (Maybe. See below)

Gravity ties a tether to both revolver (Earth) and observer (human).

But what if the human was hanging on the tether in the centripetal force example?

Answer 1: They would still feel the “simulated gravity”.

- So what’s special about gravity, and in particular the Earth’s revolution around the sun, that prevents the sensation of “extra gravity” (centripetal force)?

Answer 2: They would no longer feel the “simulated gravity” towards the other revolving mass.

- Then okay.

In good faith, I’ll assume Answer 2.

And yet…

I’m not sure.

I think if I hung onto that tether I’d still be drawn towards the edge of the spinning contraption. Why? Because my velocity pulls that way, and velocity is inertial; acceleration isn’t.

### Therefore, I conclude physicists are dumb. There’s some extra mass during daytime hours.

- It *might* be offset by sun’s gravity.

#

Ah, and yet, I got one thing backwards. Without the human being also attached to the tether, the human would feel no force. So how do gravity simulators work?

Perhaps by centrifugal force. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gravity
- See the “Balls in a rotating spacecraft” GIF.

It looks in fact to be by centripetal acceleration. 

So why would humans not feel this on Earth? 

Let’s construct an artificial gravity simulator via a tennis ball being spun around on a string, and miniature humans hang onto that string together with the tennis ball. The human would be centripetally (like “gravitationally”) pulled towards the tennis ball, unless they held on really tight.

But humans don’t hold on really tight to gravity? Oh wait, they do. Humans experience the same gravity. They’re attached by the hip. They literally can’t separate from that tether any more than the Earth can.
- So then that’s the answer.

### Back to no. See above.

But, that still doesn’t account for the centripetal pull that happens regardless.

Even if the miniature human were to hang on that string with all of their strength and barely move, they’d still feel a huge energy towards the tennis ball. It takes force to resist the centripetal action.

So even attached at the hip to that string, the miniature human would still experience an artificial gravity.

### I re-conclude that physicists are dumb. But it’s tricky, and there’s some extra mass during daytime hours.

- The human's momentum is also much smaller in the velocity direction than the Earth's (due to the lighter mass), meaning, if not for the Earth's gravity, the human would probably be sucked in by the sun (pulled in by the violent tether). The Earth meanwhile has a perfect balance of resistance due to its mass and velocity to keep a stable orbit. In other words, that centripital action is quite heavily offset by the sun's gravity due to a human's much smaller momentum, with only the Earth serving as the centripital and gravitational actor and the sun violently pulling inwards.

Ah, so the tether is the Earth. That centripital force is the gravitational force.

Then no, there is not an extra fictional-mass due to centripital action.

### Back to no.

Hmm, not quite. It's actually sort of complicated.

The angular acceleration of the Earth should cause some small force on the human, independent from the gravitational force.

However, the human's angular acceleration towards the sun is technically even heavier than the Earth's because of the lighter momentum, yet the human is tethered against it by the Earth's gravity.

That angular acceleration in that case depends on distance from the sun, so there would still be a perceived-mass difference between day hours and night hours. (Maybe really small and hard to measure).

**The Earth's gravity and the sun's gravity balance out to pin the human comfortably on the Earth. After that, the Earth's angular acceleration adds some extra pressure to the human's feet.**

And yes, that means slightly (perhaps below measurement precision levels) more perceived gravity at daytime than nighttime. 

### Yes. There’s some extra gravity-like force during daytime hours.

**Short answer:** The Earth's gravity and the sun's gravity balance out to pin the human comfortably on the Earth. After that, the Earth's angular acceleration adds some extra pressure to the sun-facing human's feet.

And yes, that means slightly (perhaps below measurement precision levels) more perceived gravity at daytime than nighttime.

Yes. There’s some extra gravity-like force during daytime hours.

Why? Because velocity is inertial; acceleration isn’t. Only the Earth is angularly accelerating, due to the sun's gravity, while the human in the Earth's gravitational field is not accelerating independent from the Earth (and the force from the pulling sun is almost completely negated by the Earth's gravitational field). 

Can derive this later. Just start with Earth and sun's gravities, add Earth's acceleration, and show it exceeds human's acceleration $\rightarrow$ therefore extra weight. 'Why don't we feel it?"

YouTube video idea: *"Are you heavier during the day than at night?"*

Suppose the Earth was somehow frozen in its orbit. Due to its gravity on you relative to that of the sun's, you'd still be comfortably on its surface experiencing things about the same.

But now, what if we resume that orbital motion (gradually again) back to normal? Well, a big ball — the Earth — would now be accelerating towards you while pulling you along on an orbital trajectory.

That acceleration might be really small — like really small. Perhaps imperceptible.

But under your feet, the ground literally moves towards you. And for that reason, you're actually a bit heavier on that side of the Earth, the sun-facing side.

But on the nighttime side, well, it's the opposite.

By perhaps imperceptibly small margins, you're a bit heavier during the day.
