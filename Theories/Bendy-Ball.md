# The Universe as Behavior of Bodies on a Bendy 4D Space-Ball

The surface of a 3D sphere can be indexed by the angle from the center vertically and the angle from the center horizontally.

As Einstein wrote, for a large enough sphere, the spherocity of the surface would be measurably-indistinguishable from a Euclidean geometry.

Thus if the spherical-surface beings are living on a planet of which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite [spherical or not] universe [...]

The same holds for a 4D sphere, except now the coordinates have 3 angle-components rather than 2.

It is measurably-indistinguishable by existing precision of distance measurement to distinguish if the universe we live in is the surface of such a very large finite 4D sphere, or different. However, as Einstein points out, such a concept has many desirable properties:

There are stars everywhere, so that the density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of fixed stars of approximately the same kind and density.

Not the least of which of the desirable properties is that, unlike in an infinite universe of densely-distributed mass, the, say, inverse-square forces of a spherical universe of densely-distributed mass do not sum to infinity at any given point, which is consistent with the obvious reality (see my summary of this point in the above footnote).

Thus, a relatively uniform distribution of mass — without the need to truncate its inverse-square magnitude — is possible on a spherical universe.

This is highly desirable since it does not give especially biased priority to any one absolute region of space over another, making a principle of relativity most-generally realisable, and remedying the mysterious paradox of the possibility of crashing into an edge.

Such a universe, indexed by 3 angular coordinates, can also be described — almost equivalently — as a modulus universe. Rather than describing a 3D surface on a 4D sphere, one can describe a standard Euclidean 3D space whose "edges" just extend into their opposite Euclidean counterpart via a modulus operation. For example, a universe of diameter $10$ would have coordinates $(1, 11, 1)$ modulus to $(1, 11$ % $10, 1) = (1, 1, 1)$.

However, treating the universe as a 3D surface on a 4D sphere via angular coordinates makes the operation almost equivalent. The only difference is that, due to the curvature, the diameter of any given circle on the sphere is slightly bigger — imperceptibly if the universe is sufficiently large — than the circumference divided by $\pi$. As Einstein described:

> ### $"$
> On their spherical surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value [...] smaller than $\pi$, the difference being the more considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison with the radius $R$ of the "world sphere." [...] It follows directly from this discussion, that for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases with the radius until the "circumference of the universe" is reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further increasing values of the radius.
> ### $``$ <sup>[^1]</sup>

But by using such coordinates, distance computations become much easier and more elegant than if for modulus operations.

Therefore, it is a preferred conceptualization of the universe, without any loss of generality given a representational spherical volume of sufficient size.

It is also easy to imagine in its whole by imagining one fewer dimension, and one's position in such an analogous but planular space as being like a body standing upon the Earth. Using that fantasy as blueprint, one can draw by analogy physics of position and motion of a volumetric space by a model that looks like the familiar dynamics along our home planet.

Similarly, as a rock rolls downhill, one can describe gravity in our volumetric universe by analogy to hills on the surface of this sphere, be it one additional dimension.

In doing so, the Earth's 3D dimensions gains an extra amplitude dimension, making the total representation of the planular space 4D, and our 4D volumetric surface gains an extra amplitude dimension, making the total representation of the volumetric space 5D, and in both cases permitting an accelerative direction for which gravity and thereby masses can pull.

Note: It's a big synchronicity I read these relevant chapters in Einstein's "Relativity The Special & General Theory"[^1] book months *after* writing my own idea to this [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Colossal-Misery.md) in a linguistic style, no less, that seemed somewhat inspired by Einstein's own linguistic voice, resembling the "gutteral" but humorous "epic-ness" that I feel strongly characterizes his language. And this happened in a state of inspiration, where I was clearly — viscerally — receiving insight from an exterior-seeming and deeper-internal source.

The distance $\mathrm{d}(\cdot)$ between any two points $x_1, x_2$ then becomes:

$$\mathrm{d}(x_1, x_2) = \lVert \cos(\frac{\Delta x}{2}) \rVert$$

> [!NOTE]
> $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(\pi, \pi, \pi)$ have max distance. $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(2\pi, 2\pi, 2\pi)$ have no distance. And $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(3\pi, 3\pi, 3\pi)$ have max distance.

The inverse-square law on a finite spherical universe then becomes $\mathrm{d}(x_1, x_2)^{-2}$.

Note I write "on" a finite spherical universe, not "in." That's because the surface, not the inner volume, is being considered. For a planular surface, like that of the Earth, space would be 2D. But for the universe in question (ours), we may regard the sphere as 4D and therefore its surface as 3D. Declinations in this surface (merely an extra 5th amplitude dimension) give us a representation for a force's accelerative direction. That declination's steepness gives us a representation for that force's accelerative magnitude.

I thereby obtain a new spacetime model for all behavior in the universe, at least relative to one body.
