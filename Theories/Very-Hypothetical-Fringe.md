First there is God, which is the universe, matter, and all forces in physics. 

Then there is the collective superconscious, which is the interaction of biological life with the physical properties of the universe that creates consciousness. 

Then there is maybe a collective subconscious, which is the network of automated, controlled matter that cryptically interacts a hidden part of people (usually) without their conscious knowledge. 

Then there is the conscious. 

Then there is the subconscious, which perhaps includes a vague sense of the collective superconscious and subconscious, includes body language, tone, and other symbolism or idiosyncrasies including linguistic and phonetic, which are perhaps also influenced by the collective superconscious and/or subconscious, and used by the latter to do cryptic communication. 

Then there are systems that have a life of their own, such as ecosystems, economic, or religious. Some have a lot of innate wisdoms, others largely do not. Both — since such systems are automated — can influence the collective subconcious in such a way that something like "demons" or "the Devil" can be attributed as them — collective subconcious operations.

The collective subconscious maybe exists, but is redundant to the collective superconscious if people become conscious of its existence and are themselves intelligent.
