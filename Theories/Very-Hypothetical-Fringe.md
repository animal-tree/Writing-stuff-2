# “The Branches of Brahman”, “Parthenon and Pantheons”, or “Angel and Demon Hierarchy”

First there is God, which is the universe, matter, and all forces in physics. 

Then there is the collective superconscious, which is the interaction of biological life with the physical properties of the universe that creates consciousness. 

Then there is maybe a collective subconscious, which is the network of automated, controlled matter that cryptically interacts a hidden part of people (usually) without their conscious knowledge. 

Then there is the conscious. 

Then there is the subconscious, which perhaps includes a vague sense of the collective superconscious and subconscious, includes body language, tone, and other symbolism or idiosyncrasies including linguistic and phonetic, which are perhaps also influenced by the collective superconscious and/or subconscious, and used or even hijacked by the latter to do cryptic communication, or by the former for its own purposes. 

Then there are systems that have a life of their own, such as ecosystems, economic, or religious. Some have a lot of innate wisdoms, others largely do not. Both — since such systems are automated — can influence the collective subconcious in such a way that something like "demons" or "the Devil" can be attributed as them — collective subconcious operations.

The collective subconscious maybe exists, but is redundant to the collective superconscious if people become conscious of its existence or are themselves intelligent.

> One bug in this system is that, when the automated intelligence of human systems have more power over a person's psychology and behaviors, including via education systems, it is possible, depending on the systems, for some consciouses to be more wise and intelligent than the collective subconscious, which has extreme power, beyond even that of economic and government systems.

The collective subconscious somehow relates to the Wernicke and Broca's areas of the brain (language centers), I think especially Wernicke. It's distinct from "culture," which is a third kind of collective consciousness. And these ideas are hinted from and via the interaction of physical matter with consciousness in writing that humans have produced over millenia, including The Word, the Adam's apple (trachea), the Tower of Babel (babble, in that allegory, as language is dividing us), and ["The [God] that can be spoken is not the eternal [God],"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230935-the-tao-that-can-be-told-is-not-the-eternal) since besides the collective subconscious (if that even exists), the collective superconscious also has some sway, varying from person to person, over the Wernicke and Broca's areas of the brain. Practices like meditation and other disciplines can help increase this connection to the "Dao," or "God." Meanwhile, other rituals, ceremonies and practices like prayer (or "manifestation"), as well as myths, stories, movies, TV shows, can all use story structure to give people interpretable meaning to their spiritual journeys, as the physical properties of the universe that create consciousness (collective superconscious), and/or as the collective subconscious, shape those experiences.

Systems of nature, and those Pantheons / Angels and Demons of the collective consciousness (not sure if they belong to superconscious or subconscious, or both, e.g., intermediating, or depends), in good equilibrium, have a checks and balances that prevents any one power from gaining too much disproportionate influence, in the sense of being able to cause injustice, which the physics of the universe (God's), aren't (directly), nor in all likelihood the collective superconscious that is the *direct* influence of those physics (God) on biological life, but everything below, through methods that are not "automated" (as in, via stochastic modulations directly from Nature in the standard deviations of quantum physics, not via the determined, e.g., gravity, laws of physics), can.
