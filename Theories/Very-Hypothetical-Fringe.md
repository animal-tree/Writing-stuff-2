# “The Branches of Brahman”, “Parthenon and Pantheons”, or “Angel and Demon Hierarchy”

First there is God, which is the universe, matter, and all forces in physics. 

Then there is the collective superconscious, which is the interaction of biological life with the physical properties of the universe that creates consciousness. 

Then there is maybe a collective subconscious, which is the network of automated, controlled matter that cryptically interacts a hidden part of people (usually) without their conscious knowledge. 

Then there is the conscious. 

Then there is the subconscious, which includes a vague sense of the collective subconscious, including body language, tone, and other symbolism or idiosyncrasies including linguistic and phonetic, but also of the collective superconscious, also sometimes including body language, tone, and other symbolism or idiosyncrasies including linguistic and phonetic. 

Then there are systems that have a life of their own, such as ecosystems, and that don't have a life of their own, but are powerful, such as economic. Some have innate wisdoms that are susceptible to disruption, others do a lot of disrupting. Both — since such systems are automated — can influence the collective subconcious in such a way that something like "demons" or "the Devil" can be attributed to them.
