**Question:** How does the angular acceleration of the Earth's motion around the sun affect weight?

# Resolution

- Suppose a human is standing on the equator at noon. Consider acceleration in the Sun direction for both the Earth and the human. The Earth's acceleration towards the Sun is $X$ amount such that its inertial velocity is captured in a stable orbital motion (exactly the Sun's gravity). The human's acceleration in the Sun's direction is negative ($Y < 0$), since the Earth's gravitational field pulls/stabilizes the human towards the Earth. Therefore the Earth's acceleration towards the Sun $X$ exceeds the human's acceleration towards the Sun $Y$, and therefore the human experiences an extra weight in the direction of the Earth due to the Earth's angular acceleration. This angular acceleration is really small, veritabily $5e^{-3} \frac{m}{s^2}$, imperceptible to a human, but it means that the human's weight is officially greater due to the Earth's motion.
- This might seem confusing since the human also has an inertial velocity that corresponds with the Earth's inertial velocity tangent to the Earth's orbit. The human however doesn't have an "inertial angular acceleration" since such a thing doesn't exist.

**YouTube video idea:** *"Are you heavier during the day than at night?"*

Suppose the Earth was somehow frozen in its orbit. Due to its gravity on you relative to that of the sun's, you'd still be comfortably on its surface experiencing things about the same.

But now, what if we resume that orbital motion (gradually again) back to normal? Well, a big ball — the Earth — would now be accelerating towards you while pulling you along on an orbital trajectory.

That acceleration might be really small — like really small. Perhaps imperceptible.

But under your feet, the ground literally moves towards you. And for that reason, you're actually a bit heavier on that side of the Earth, the sun-facing side.

But on the nighttime side, well, it's the opposite.

By perhaps imperceptibly small margins, you're a bit heavier during the day.

# Conclusions

- **You're heavier at noon!**
- **Objects fall faster at noon!**
- **You get to fly a little at night!**

Disclaimer in case you're standing on one of the poles: move slightly in any direction for effect.

The further you go from the poles, the stronger the effect.

If you live on the equator, then the effect is strongest.

- **If you want to change the weight of an object, all you have to do is move it!** Oh, that sounds reminiscent of something more general... No wait. More special. But instead of time dilation and length contraction, we now have anisotropic weight perturbations based on latitude and longitude (and velocity is independent).

Disclaimer: there may be some weird diagonal motion along the latitudinal/longitudinal grid that would not change your weight at all, since latitudinally, moving towards the poles weakens the effect, while longitudinally, moving towards the opposite side of the Earth reverses the effect.

"The further you go from the poles, the stronger the effect." - due to the angle at which you are being angularly accelerated towards or away from by the Earth.
