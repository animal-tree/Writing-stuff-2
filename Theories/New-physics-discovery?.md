**Question:** How does the angular velocity of the Earth's motion around the sun affect weight?

# Resolution

- Suppose a human is standing on the equator at noon. Consider acceleration in the Sun direction for both the Earth and the human. The Earth's acceleration towards the Sun is $X$ amount such that its inertial velocity is captured in a stable orbital motion (exactly the Sun's gravity). This becomes its "angular velocity". The human's acceleration in the Sun's direction is negative ($Y < 0$), since the Earth's gravitational field pulls/stabilizes the human towards the Earth, accounting for both the Sun's and Earth's forces. Therefore the Earth's acceleration towards the Sun $X$ exceeds the human's acceleration towards the Sun $Y$, and therefore the human experiences an extra weight in the direction of the Earth due to the Earth's angular velocity. This sun-directed acceleration is $X$... why isn't it perceptible to a human?
  - The Earth's sun-directed acceleration should be perceptible to a human if it weren't cancelled out in the Earth direction by Earth's gravity. However, there is a portion of it in teh angular direction not cancelled out.
- This might seem confusing since the human also has an inertial velocity that corresponds with the Earth's inertial velocity tangent to the Earth's orbit. But the human's angular velocity around the Sun can't be inertial because the human has no angular velocity independent from the pressure of the Earth. If the ground of the Earth suddenly became ephemeral (a hole appears), the human wouldn't keep along the same angular trajectory, but would, rather, fall through.

**YouTube video idea:** *"Are you heavier during the day than at night?"*

Suppose the Earth was somehow frozen in its orbit. Due to its gravity on you relative to that of the sun's, you'd still be comfortably on its surface experiencing things about the same.

But now, what if we resume that orbital motion (gradually again) back to normal? Well, a big ball — the Earth — would now be accelerating towards you while pulling you along on an orbital trajectory.

That acceleration might be really small — like really small. Perhaps imperceptible.

But under your feet, the ground literally moves towards you. And for that reason, you're actually a bit heavier on that side of the Earth, the sun-facing side.

But on the nighttime side, well, it's the opposite.

By perhaps imperceptibly small margins, you're a bit heavier during the day.

# Conclusions

- **You're heavier at noon!**
- **Objects fall faster at noon!**
- **You get to fly a little at night!**

Disclaimer in case you're standing on one of the poles: move slightly in any direction for effect.

The further you go from the poles, the stronger the effect.

If you live on the equator, then the effect is strongest.

- **If you want to change the weight of an object, all you have to do is move it!** We now have (really small) anisotropic weight perturbations based on latitude and longitude (and velocity is independent).

Disclaimer: there may be some weird diagonal motion along the latitudinal/longitudinal grid that would not change your weight at all, since latitudinally, moving towards the poles weakens the effect, while longitudinally, moving towards the opposite side of the Earth reverses the effect.

"The further you go from the poles, the stronger the effect." - due to the angle at which you are being angularly accelerated towards or away from by the Earth. The acceleration of the Earth is towards the Sun, whereas your acceleration is towards the earth, so at larger angles, the two are less at odds. However, it means that on the poles, you experience the full acceleration sideways. That acceleration towards the Sun divides into its component directions, with none of the component transferring to your feet at the poles, but rather to your torso.

- **If you want to weigh less *sideways* in the direction of the sun, just stand comfortably on the Earth's poles!**
