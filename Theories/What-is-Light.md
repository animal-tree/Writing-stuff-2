# What is Light

If light has no momentum bump,

then how do our eyes see unpolarized light? Shouldn't the momenta cancel out? Of course. The unpolarized waves destroy each other, as each polarization acts in destructive interference with each other.

At the very least, it means the probability distribution (the wave function) of the light wave is independent from the polarization direction/orientation, or else visible light — which is unpolarized usually (e.g. sunlight, fire) — wouldn't be visible. The probabilities due to the interference of polarizations would cancel out (unless the probabilities conveniently normalized to a uniform distribution every time, though that should disrupt the [Fresnel diffraction](https://youtu.be/y9c8oZ49pFc?si=kSTkCh56g60vPAKk)[^1]).

And yet, even if they materialize via the wave function independent from polarization's (or the lack of it's) interference effects, how is it their electromagnetic effects compound to "push" electrons enough for our eyes to see? What other way do we have of seeing photons? This electromagnetic effect is the only attributed source of momentum, [usually](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)[^1] and standardly. 

But that can't be, since unpolarized electromagnetic effects are usually thought to cancel out, and experiment — the reception of EM waves by antennas — supports this: those waves interfere when destructively aligned, or at least their phases do, and the conflicting accelerations induced on electrons must similarly interfere, via Newton's 2nd law and additive force destruction.

Then unpolarized light might reasonably have some other source of momentum for our eyes to see. Perhaps intrinsic momentum

not dependent on electric-magnetic effects.

But Newton's 3rd law is violated by photons when it comes to their interaction with gravity. Gravity causes photons to "react" via centripetal acceleration towards masses, but the equal and opposite reaction isn't present, meaning $\frac{\partial F_\gamma}{\partial t}$ $\neq$ $-\frac{\partial F_{e^{-}}}{\partial t}$, where $F_\gamma$ is the (e.g. gravitational) force on the photon $\gamma$ by the electron $e^{-}$, and $F_{e^{-}}$ is the force on the electron $e^{-}$ by the photon $\gamma$.

So perhaps Newton's 2nd law (involving sums of forces) is also violated, but this is strange since that would imply that an electron can accelerate in two conflicting directions at once as light's polarization of two conflicting photons ($\gamma$'s) pushes it this way or that.

This multi-branched non-summation sounds like quantum mechanics, where two locations and directions of acceleration are allowed, at least probabilistically via the wave function. But then this branching would literally have to happen in our eyes for our eyes to see, and traditionally that is considered a "measurement." "Quantum effects don't usually survive in wet environments" as it's often said about the feasibility of quantum effects in the brain. More generally, "the wave function collapses under observation." All evidence using detectors in multi-slit diffraction experiments supports this. So the eyes would not be able to see.

Therefore, there is a bump.

Light has momentum (intrinsically and independent of electric-magnetic effect. If the polarizations of electromagnetic waves cancel out in unpolarized visible light, then this is a proof, of both that light $\neq$ EM and that light has a different source of momentum.).

What I wrote earlier [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Disproof-and-Unified.md) (ignore the irrelevant lower fourth):

### Hypothetical Critiques

- Here's one possible critique: the accelerations (forces) from conflicting polarizations don't interfere because both act in the direction of velocity. However, those forces are only because of the electric and magnetic fields, which both depend on polarization and are both interfered with, so no. The electromagnetic "momentum" is cancelled out in unpolarized light, and there'd be no physical trace by which to see.
- An alternative critique is that those fields don't interfere with each other and two superimposed photons with opposite polarizations somehow independently affect the electron, but then there's the question of "in which order do they impart their two independent effects?" Given that those electric and magnetic vibrations are conflicting, by Newton's 2nd law, the forces cancel out if they happen concurrently (and if they don't, then the question of the universe's sequential order for every single compounding interaction happening not in parallel has to be answered and why we don't notice artifacts from those time delays, since the electron would have to do a full vibration before moving on to listening to the next photon in the sequence).
- Perhaps instead the force is some probabilistic average (expected value) of possibilities relying on the wave function, but then that average (expected value) is zero.
