then how do our eyes see unpolarized light? Shouldn't the momenta cancel out? Of course. The unpolarized waves destroy each other, as each polarization acts in destructive interference with each other.

At the very least, it means the probability distribution (the wave function) of the light wave is independent from the polarization direction/orientation, or else visible light — which is unpolarized usually (e.g., sunlight, fire) — wouldn't be visible. The probabilities due to the interference of polarizations would cancel out (unless the probabilities conveniently normalized to a uniform distribution every time, though that should disrupt the [Fresnel diffraction](https://youtu.be/y9c8oZ49pFc?si=kSTkCh56g60vPAKk)[^1]).

And yet, even if they materialize via the wave function independent from polarization's (or the lack of its) interference effects, how is it their electromagnetic effects compound to "push" electrons enough for our eyes to see? What other way do we have of seeing photons? This electromagnetic effect is the only attributed source of momentum, [usually](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)[^1] and standardly. 

But that can't be, since unpolarized electromagnetic effects are usually thought to cancel out, and experiment — the reception of EM waves by antennas — supports this: those waves interfere when destructively aligned, or at least their phases do, and the conflicting accelerations induced on electrons must similarly interfere, via Newton's 2nd law and additive force destruction.

Then unpolarized light might reasonably have some other source of momentum for our eyes to see. Perhaps intrinsic momentum

not dependent on electric-magnetic effects.

But Newton's 3rd law is violated by photons when it comes to their interaction with gravity. Gravity causes photons to "react" via centripetal acceleration towards masses, but the equal and opposite reaction isn't present, meaning $\frac{\partial F_\gamma}{\partial t}$ $\neq$ $-\frac{\partial F_{e^{-}}}{\partial t}$, where $F_\gamma$ is the (e.g., gravitational) force on the photon by the electron, and $F_{e^{-}}$ is the force on the electron by the photon. 

Quick proof, since this requires considering a photon as "bending": the force on the photon, $F_\gamma$ $=$ $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $=$ $\frac{\partial \frac{hf}{c}}{\partial t}$ is non-zero because despite the usual scalar computation, the photon's momentum is a vector quantity (the direction of its velocity), so this value $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $\neq$ $0$ when the force of gravity bending it (and therefore changing its direction) is applied, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the photon, and thus $F_\gamma$ $\neq$ $-F_{e^{-}}$ $=$ $0$, violating Newton's 3rd law. (Either way, note, this is a tangent to the larger point).

So perhaps Newton's 2nd law (involving sums of forces) is also violated, but this is strange since that would imply that an electron can accelerate in two conflicting directions at once as light's polarization of two conflicting photons pushes it this way or that.

This multi-branched non-summation sounds like quantum mechanics, where two locations and directions of acceleration are allowed, at least probabilistically via the wave function. But then this branching would literally have to happen in our eyes for our eyes to see, and traditionally that is considered a "measurement." "Quantum effects don't usually survive in wet environments" as it's often said about the feasibility of quantum effects in the brain. More generally, "the wave function collapses under observation." All evidence using detectors in multi-slit diffraction experiments supports this. So the eyes would not be able to see.

Therefore, there is a bump.

Light has momentum (intrinsically and independent of electric-magnetic effect. If the polarizations of electromagnetic waves cancel out in unpolarized visible light, then this is a proof, of both that light $\neq$ EM and that light has a different source of momentum.).

What I wrote earlier [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Disproof-and-Unified.md) (ignore the irrelevant lower fourth):

### Hypothetical Critiques

- Here's one possible critique: the accelerations (forces) from conflicting polarizations don't interfere because both act in the direction of velocity. However, those forces are only because of the electric and magnetic fields (see [here](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX) for an explanation), which both depend on polarization and are both interfered with, so no. The electromagnetic "momentum" is cancelled out in unpolarized light, and there'd be no physical trace by which to see.
- An alternative critique is that those fields don't interfere with each other and two superimposed photons with opposite polarizations somehow independently affect the electron, but then there's the question of "in which order do they impart their two independent effects?" Given that those electric and magnetic vibrations are conflicting, by Newton's 2nd law, the forces cancel out if they happen concurrently (and if they don't, then the question of the universe's sequential order for every single compounding interaction happening not in parallel has to be answered and why we don't notice artifacts from those time delays, since the electron would have to do a full vibration before moving on to listening to the next photon in the sequence).
- Perhaps instead the force is some probabilistic average (expected value) of possibilities relying on the wave function, but then that average (expected value) is zero.

Ah, but upon more thought, this conclusion, while still holding, has a better answer than the depicted "momentum-bump" spacetime curve. Rather, replace that with a flat line: eliminate any physical momentum imparted by the photon directly.

Let's return to the "proof" statement: "light $\neq$ EM and that light has a different source of momentum." There is one other way to satisfy this besides giving the photon that "momentum-bump" collision force.

Instead, photons have at least one other known property besides their electromagnetic (EM) effects and that's their interaction (absorption and emission) with electrons.

And that absorption and emission induces its own momentum delta. For example, when an electron transitions energy levels due to the absorption of photons, its momentum also changes.

Therefore, there is a subtler, more elegant alternative to imparting photons with momenta beyond just the EM effects, and that's defining/observing this absorption/emission energy-change interaction with electrons.

It's that interaction, and the subsequent energy excitations of electrons in proteins called photopsins, that allows our eyes to see, and this interaction is indeed independent to the photon's polarization.

So my thought experiment has a simpler[^2] resolution. The spacetime curve then becomes:

and the electron interaction, distinct from EM and independent to polarization, is responsible for color perception.

More speculatively, frequency might have one other momentum-like effect that isn't reproducible via [electromagnetic push](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX). Higher frequency should perhaps correspond to more resistance in light's bending towards centripetal accelerations/forces such as gravity, if the analogy to momentum is really taken to its extreme, while still respecting the constancy of the speed of light in its linear/inertial speed. I can regard this momentum of light then as an "inner velocity," by which centripetal forces are resisted. This inner velocity in my opinion likely determines the absorption or emission mechanics of the photon by the electron.

[^1]: Those channels are amazing by the way.
[^2]: However, a more thorough resolution can include both the electron interaction and the "momentum-bump," and, in a roundabout way not discussed here, answer Baryonic asymmetry, by modification of the EM field with respect to polarization and a more in-depth neutrino interaction.
