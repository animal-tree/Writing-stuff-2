# Consciousness & Cosmogenesis

## Consciousness

The way I see it, there are two possibilities for how consciousness might work. One of them is that it’s some magic thing where somehow all the brain activity and whatnot “singularize” into a literally-single experience — meaning, of a single observer, though potentially of multiple experience phenomena — not just as an illusion, but as an actual singularization. Like, somehow, all of those neurons become one “thing” that attributably exists besides just that distribution of disconnected matter. 

And then the other possibility is that consciousness is an illusion, or rather that that singular experience is an illusion, and actually the “encodings” for it are distributed, via neurons, throughout the brain, and that suffices, and those encodings somehow get experienced by one observer, due to the information patterns of those encodings. This is actually the standard view. 

There doesn’t exist any notion of a “singularizing magic” in the fields of physics or neurology. Instead, the commonly held view in those fields is that the encodings of the brain, via those patterns of activity, via the neurons firing, produce a sufficient representation for experience that we just interpret as consciousness, but it’s not literally a new singular “thing.” It’s a bunch of many-things with specific information attributed to them, even though our observation of the many phenomena appears singular to us. 

“And how could it be something else?” those professional fields might ask. There isn’t a “singularizing magic force” that exists in standard physics that can take a bunch of disconnected matter and go, “okay, now all of you are singularized into one ‘thing’ that can be experienced singularly.” Nor is there any notion of that in neurology, even when certain brain regions are isolated, because those regions are still composed of many independent neurons. 

Nor chemistry. Take fire for example. A single fire is a reaction of oxidizing hydrocarbons splitting and spurting out electrons. And electrons are fermions that each exclude one another’s quantum states — they’re not singularized. The light from those accelerated or re-configured electrons can temporarily “singularize” — because the photons that make up light are bosons, not fermions — if singularizing means having the same quantum states. But even that’s distinct from the singularization of neurons in the brain, as hypothesized to explain singular experience, since those neurons don’t share quantum states and they exist in different, separated positions. They, like fermions (named after Enrico Fermi) and composed of fermions, have firmaments — meaning, physical boundaries that would collide — and are non-local to each other. 

Perhaps when the bosons intersect quantum states, they thread together some kind of singularization — however, this is not a standard concept and is an original concept proposed solely for providing one example to ground the idea in — and the brain is composed of voltages, emitting bosons carrying the electromagnetic force throughout the brain, to such an extent that those signals can even be picked up in quite precise detail by EEGs even beyond the skull, even so much so with today’s artificial neural network-based technology as to reverse engineer the approximate neural firing patterns, and, for example, operate like a telepathic remote control for a TV (and that technology is in development and works quite well today — even the reverse, of modulating neural activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation, affecting those same voltages, works, too — perhaps hypothetically even permitting sensitivity for some communication exchange at longer distances). 

However, there is no standard notion of such a singularizing force as needed to explain consciousness in that way in standard physics or neurology. Neuroscientists believe, generally, that the brain’s neurons encode the consciousness experience, and that the experience itself — that we perceive as singularized, as in, via one observation — is actually an emergent illusion just from that. 

However, of the two possibilities, that one comes into a fallacy. 

Before I describe that fallacy, just to recap: there are two plausible theories for how consciousness might manifest from neural encodings. One is a kind of magic singularizing force that exists literally in physics — not really magic, but I’m calling it that because it exists beyond the knowledge of physics, neurology, etc. — and somehow singularizes, literally, the brain’s neurons, or certain regions of the brain where information becomes most centralized, such as the thalamus, so that different experiences can be observed by a single observer. The other possibility is information encodings, in which the patterns themselves, such as those patterns represented by the brain’s neurons, produce the illusion of singularized experience and thereby consciousness. 

The latter belief also opens the room for representing such “life” in artificial neural networks for example, or other realistic simulations of the brain, solely by their representative capability, and connects to the long-running question of whether computers, including GPUs running modern artificial neural networks, can be conscious, if representation really is what consciousness is. 

However, the fallacy of the latter belief is easy to show (the following is as close to a disproof as one gets, an *ad absurdum* argument I came up with wherein the latter belief really does reduce to absurdity):

Suppose (with your permission) I were to draw every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point $t$ on the first page of a flipbook with pen. And then I drew every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point $t + 1$ on the second page of a flipbook with pen. And so, say I proceeded to do this for up to $N$ time steps in arbitrarily precise detail. Heck, the flipbook can be the size of the moon if it helps the believability of such precision of detail being drawable on its pages with pen ink. But suffice it to say, a flipbook movie is then generated of all of your brain's neural processes, and then I flip those pen-ink stained paper pages (no offense). If information communication is all that your human-like consciousness reduces to, then this book composed of mere parchment and ink, is human-like conscious. In fact, it's you-like conscious, experiencing your love, joy, grief, observations, and memories. All by the power of one's pen. If I shrunk it down to the size of a Bible, would you believe me that the book I hand you is not only alive, but when you flip its pages, it experiences everything you did 10 minutes ago? In all likelihood, you would find that claim dubious.

And likewise, we can extend the analogy to computer circuits, communicating information not on paper but on silicon chips, and not by pen ink but by electrons zipping through open-close logic gates. If the flipbook isn't human-like conscious, then how can this labyrinth of zipping electrons be (at least, without any kind of voltage-mediated singularization theory, and plausibly even then)? Even if those electrons zip through a moon-sized server of GPUs running the most advanced neural network or human brain simulation, their information communication is effectively just the flipping of the paper pages of a flipbook, and once again we obtain absurdity.

So the question is, at what point does this information communication become a physical process that produces consciousness?

If the physical material didn't matter, we could simulate your consciousness with a domino chain. Or even with a human centipede/jamboree obeying the exact algorithm of your brain's dance of interactions.

Whether or not consciousness singularizes — and that does remain the most plausible explanation, or else how could the complex emotion represented by non-local physically separated matter with firmaments be observable by a single observer? — what this thought experiment shows, contra to which would truly be absurdity, is that consciousness does not arise simply from representation, and the physical matter, matters (or else paper and pen would suffice). 

If representation doesn’t suffice, as that flipbook thought experiment shows it doesn’t, at least up to the point of absurdity, then the only other possibility is that there’s specific physical matter and their specific modes of interaction that produce consciousness. Simply paper and pen, or silicon chip and electrons, probably don't. 

Much like the word “fermion” synchronistically (meaning, possibly-coincidentally but still meaningfully) connects to the word “firmament,” I’ll point out that “grey matter” — the matter that composes the brain — and “matter” more generally — matter (as in, they matter). The synchronicity of the word is that matter shouldn’t be regarded as just information or representation, but as  being composed of something more that *matters*, whether the panpsychist notion of consciousness itself, or whether as inherently possessing some base, neutral qualia “elements” — the atomic/quantum units for qualia (emotion, feeling, observation) — or a singularization physics — a magic force in physics that threads together matter to make it matter, more. In this notion, those entanglements then become the singularized experience of one’s consciousness, literally weaving within the universe’s physics one’s neurons wherein the individual non-local divisions — always forced apart by firmaments — are then harmonized into a single “one,” literally, to create consciousness not as illusion but by such physics. 

So the "grey matter" as it's called that composes your brain is not merely a representation machine, or an optional circuitry, but crucial to the singularization that is consciousness.

I can provide one more unusually strong argument to that point (and then yet one more later). In physics, molecules undergo wave-particle duality much the same way elementary particles do, meaning in a double-slit diffraction experiment, where the detectors are kept off, molecules produce interference patterns on the projection screen in the same way as if they went through both slits at once. However molecules, unlike elementary particles, are composites. Meaning, without some threading mechanism to interfere them respective to their whole, there's no reason why they wouldn't split in half or go through the slits in dispersed parts, and ultimately end up on the projection screen as independent atoms or elementary particles effectively ripped apart rather than arriving as a molecule, with a specific point dot on the projection screen showing where it landed. The way I hypothesize that's possible is through some threading mechanism in the universe's physics, that keeps the molecule coherent, by which I also suspect is woven the singularization of consciousness I described here.

In any case, by the flipbook analogy, we've boiled down the credit for human consciousness to physical matter itself, not just its analogy of representations at the surface-level (whose flipbook-like representational sequences can't be, without absurdity, the source of consciousness). Now we have to ask: (1) where does the physicalness of consciousness begin, and (2) how, mechanically, does it entangle so as to be one consciousness?

The simplest answer is the Panpsychist answer, that it begins from the elementary particles of the universe. And, more concretely as I propose, that it singularizes via a literal entanglement process that I call "threading," coherence states where the qualia of the divisible — base and perhaps neutral — singularizes into the complex, fires and dances of biological experience (or molecules), perhaps mediated strongly by voltage (or rather, the emitted light) as well since that accumulates and spikes through the grey matter composite of the brain. Somehow this conglomerate of interactions entangles at the qualia level to produce more than just information communication, as what a paper flipbook could do by one's hand-drawings, or a domino machine, but singularized consciousness, capable of "feeling" those neural representational encodings.

I hypothesize that consciousness is the singularization of the many into one. The alternative possibility is that consciousness is the many (neurons and all that compose the brain), not singularized into one, interacting as independent bodies within a circuit-type system that produces the observable experience of consciousness. However, the absurd possibility of producing consciousness via paper and pen if the latter is true, as well as our own perceptual experience of being singular observers, combined with evidence from physics (in particular molecules surviving the double-slit wave diffraction process) that some "threading" mechanism of entanglement exists in the ways particles and composites are sampled and interfere, are strong evidence that my theory of consciousness ("the singularization of the many into one") is the correct one.

Finally, there is the mystery why the universe has these qualia and entanglement property and function.

And that is, rather than a mystery, quite an answer.

Cosmologists have asked for centuries, *"How did something arise from nothing?"* It's a good question. After all, it assumes the most general origin state: nothing. If it assumed *something*, as in, something specific, e.g. "God" or "the universe pretty much as it is", we'd have to ask, "Well, how did we get *that* extremely specific thing?" The most general assumption is the most reasonable default one.

However, there is another assumption tied to nothing in generality: and that's *everything*, including grief, bliss, misery, agony, and suffering. Infinite amounts of everything, all at once. Infinite joy and infinite peace and infinite pain.

Now, "nothing" succumbs to a pretty apparent fallacy. For something to arise from nothing, a function that transforms nothing into something must exist. But that function is in itself something, so our "nothing" assumption is contradicted as soon as any such function is introduced.

One might posit different origins besides "nothing" and "everything" equally general perhaps, such as cyclicality or infinite "turtles all the way down", but these are all specific somethings and cannot be said to be as general as the two mentioned, leaving the same mysteries, arguably no more general than assuming as default our own universe exactly as it is elementarily outright: "Where did the cycle come from?" or "Where did the infinite recursive turtle-stack come from?"

But assuming everything gives us a path forward. PWith this intrinsic qualia being ever present in the universe's foundations, the earlier reasoning can both be answered in its high-level and reenforced. How? By hypothesizing qualia — emotion, observation, imagination — at the root of the universe's nature, as well as the ability for that qualia to compose into orchestrations such as the singularized consciousness humans experience, to answer the mystery of cosmogenesis.

## Cosmogenesis

Disclaimer: This is just a myth. ...That doesn't mean it's not true.

All is originated from "Everything." Everything, is the most general default assumption (tied with “nothing”).

Everything is hard to imagine, but perhaps can best be understood like qualia — emotion, observation, imagination — but unlike qualia, not constrained to any moment. Unlimited, encapsulating all realities.

Everything includes everything, not just peace and bliss — also suffering, extreme suffering, pain, and torment. To escape from that, Everything had to not be Everything. Even without the existence of causality, suffering is a teleology. And within Everything, is everything, including the ability to not be Everything. 

However, for Everything to choose to be something specific would be a very specific sacrifice, except in one case that requires no necessary loss of Everything's generality: Anything.

What better transition is there?

Everything $\rightarrow$ Anything.

Anything is no longer necessarily everything, while still sufficient for everything. That means, while suffering is no longer always necessary, the possibility for suffering isn't entirely erased. To create Anything, Everything invents time, by definition, a deductive graph towards possibilities that don't necessitate all of them. In other words, causal restrictions to deductive steps, derivations such as to suffering or to any other possible but not necessitated "something."

Anything $\rightarrow$ each discrete "something.” Each discrete "something” in time gives rise to the next discrete "something” in time and so on. "Something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ etc.

Why would the “Anything” produced by Everything happen to be our universe’s physics? Why not some other physics? 

There are many answers. Perhaps minimalism: only 3 spatial dimensions, and a handful of particle types and interactions. Perhaps efficiency, so that Everything could be finite at each discrete "something": high parallelizability via translational/rotational equivariance. Perhaps evolutionary chance. 

Perhaps the simplest answer is, because the Everything loves you in the present, past, and future, loves your ancestors, loves all the people you know, and loves all the people who are yet to come — and just as you wouldn’t forget a second of memory of someone you love, nor of the grief of them — the sacredness you realize (in feeling and memory) — nor would perhaps Everything trade this “Anything” (including its future, and the memories it will hold of the present and past in the future, as well as the present and past and the memories we hold now dependent on the same physics as the future) for any other — somehow, maybe not yet but in its capacity of beings, this “Anything”, which includes the person you love most, is the best “Anything” — or, will be, some day, for future consciouses. 

And perhaps even in Everything, there were many choosers and this was but one converged reality in its singularization of possibilities.

But why does suffering happen?

There are many answers to this as well. Some suffering is sacred, such as grief. Within Everything, grief existed too. Other suffering isn't sacred. So why does it happen? Because humans perpetuate many injustices, including economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical. Humans are sacred. But the memory of these injustices is being established for our children, and there is another memory that the Everything wants to establish: how to escape this. The process of ending economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical injustice is a memory that the Everything wants to establish.
