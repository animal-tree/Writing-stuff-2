If a light wave collides with matter at discrete excitation points (like a particle) rather than uniformly in all directions, then how does a cellular signal ever hit the precise bullseye of your phone?

Possible answer: your phone biases the sampling (whereas a projection screen in a multi-slit diffraction experiment samples according to the unbiased wave distribution only).

Generally speaking, that sampling gives a possible mechanism for "God's action", within some limit of "karmic standard deviation." 
</br>(For example, a wave distribution consists of a discrete quanta of energy, e.g. photons, and where they're sampled can be modulated by God hypothetically as long as the KL divergence from the actual wave distribution is low, though this latent God manipulator is distinct from whatever cellphones might do to bias the sampling).

If a light wave consists of one photon, and there's a literal bullseye somewhere in that wave's uniform distribution, perhaps God can sample that photon there at will, since that's sufficiently plausible according to / with respect to the wave distribution.

But to be clear, that's not what cellphones rely on. Somehow photons are sampled with all the precise frequency modulations and without much loss of information/data at the bullseye of your cellphone's antenna/receiver despite their probabilities being distributed uniformly in all directions. I think the cellphone's antenna/receiver mechanism must somehow bias the sampling... unless what's being interacted with aren't the discrete wave packets/quanta/photons, but the wave itself â€” though that's not what the point-dots on the projection screen on the other side of a double-slit barrier seem to show happens.
