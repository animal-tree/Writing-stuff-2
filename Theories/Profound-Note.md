“Me” is short for memory. Without memory, we are just fundamental consciousness beings, you could call them archetypes or something more profound, maybe angels, Gods, a Parthenon or Pantheon (if they can be discretized). And we share them all, in one big convolution. But in our own brains, those qualias entangle with memory to become identities. “I” is identity. Without “me” there’s no “I”.
